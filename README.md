#### [Every Noise at Once](http://everynoise.com/): 
  Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,368 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify as of 2020-05-22. The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier. Is a project from [Glenn McDonald](https://twitter.com/glenn_mcdonald).
